this is a project on The Odin Project, linked at the bottom.

Private-events is an app designed for users to be able to create events, invite other users, and accept invites to others events themselves.

This is a very simple app using mySQL and Ruby on Rails. Users can create events, profiles, and invite other users to events.
Non-signed in users can still view events, but can not invite others.

This is a very basic app built as a small projet to get used to the basics of Ruby on Rails, so there is little to no validation of users.
